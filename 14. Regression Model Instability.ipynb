    "Regression analysis allows us to estimate coefficients in a function which approximately relates multiple data sets. We hypothesize a specific form for this function and then find coefficients which fit the data well, working under the assumption that deviations from the model can be considered noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building such a model, we accept that it cannot perfectly predict the dependent variable. Here we would like to evaluate the accuracy of the model not by how well it explains the dependent variable, but by how stable it is (that is, how stable the regression coefficients are) with respect to our sample data. After all, if a model is truly a good fit, it should be similar, say, for two random halves of our data set that we model individually. Otherwise, we cannot assume that the model isn't simply an artifact of the particular sample of data we happened to choose, or that it will be predictive of new data points.\n",

    "We'll be using linear regressions here for illustration purposes, but the same considerations apply for all regression models. Below we define a wrapper function for the linear regression from statsmodels so we can use it later."
